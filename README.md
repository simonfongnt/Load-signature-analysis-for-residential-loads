# Load signature analysis for residential loads

Load signature (LS) is a unique identifier of individual appliances to be distinguished in a composite load signal. This area of research aimed to identify the appliances via the main circuit.  Hence a nonintrusive appliance load monitoring method (NALM) was introduced in 1980 to monitor a system consisted of number of appliances with sophisticated analysis on signal waveforms of total consumption [6] and does not requires any individual sensors installed on appliance. This method is able to apply to the outlet-level, which means the appliances with same power consumption magnitude can be grouped as one. Many researches adopted the idea and improve this method in load signature studies. This paper [7] implements NALM algorithm by comparing result of numerous signatures such as active power, reactive power, apparent power and mainly focus on appliances with high power consumption (such as water heater, air conditioner and fridge) which power companies are interested in. Because of the privacy reason and excessive cost of installing individual sensor to every appliance or device, NILM algorithms are popularized to disaggregate the individual signalsâ€™ superposition [8]. NILM researches are dominating and machine learning has become inevitable technique to tackle this problem.
